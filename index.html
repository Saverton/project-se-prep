                        Hello! I am an up and coming software engineer who loves coding. in September of 2021, I found my passion for coding 
                        through taking the <a href = "https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-a"><strong>AP Computer 
                        Science</strong></a> course at my high school. I love learning new concepts and languages, and I also love working 
                        on personal projects to improve my skills. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I made it a personal goal to complete <em>every last</em> practice problem in our computer science textbook by 
                        the time of the AP test so that I would have a solid foundation in the fundamentals of programming. Furthermore, I 
                        sought out online resources to expand my knowledge and capabilities, enrolling in Harvard's 
                        <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/games/2018/"><strong>GD50</strong></a> course, all about the fundamentals of 
                        game development. Using what I learned from this course, I have worked on a small handful of larger video game 
                        projects for fun.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Having graduated from High School, I am now seeking an entryway into a career of software development, and have decided to go 
                        about it in a less traditional way. Rather than go straight into college, I am enrolling in a coding boot camp known as the
                        <a href="https://flatironschool.com/"><strong>Flatiron School</strong></a>. Once I have graduated from their incredible Software 
                        Engineeringprogram, I will seek an entry-level developer position, and gain some experience in the field before pouring 
                        excessive time and money into a degree.

                                This was my very first coding "project" (if you could call it that) . It wasn't planned to be anything
                                special or intricate, more so just me wondering if I could make a somewhat engaging game with my skills at the time. It's 
                                all text-based, so nothing too glamorous, and the code itself is a mess. This was before I had learned OOP, 
                                so all the code is in one large file and the game runs entirely through methods. It is fully functional, however,
                                and the computer that you play against does have a decent algorithm that provides a challenge. For more information 
                                on the algorithm, check the read me on the project's GitHub page.

                                This is my first full game project using Lua and the <a href="https://love2d.org/wiki/Main_Page"><strong>LOVE2D 
                                framework</strong></a>! This began as a practice project, testing out my abilities within the new language and framework, 
                                but soon developed into a full on project. Once my version of the original game was established (the player, the ships, 
                                the shield elements, etc.), I started building in polish features so that the game could be shared among friends and family.
                                I experimented with creating my own GUI classes, difficulty variation, animations, sound design, high-score saving and 
                                even a super-secret boss battle on level 12! The game is fun and addicting (not to mention tough!), and it is almost as fun 
                                to play as it was to code!

                                Asteroids was another project created with a similar purpose to Space invaders, although it didn't receive quite as much attention
                                from me beyond getting the base gameplay to work properly. This creation was also a bit more faithful to the original arcade style 
                                <em>Asteroids</em> game when compared to Space Invaders and its inspiration. The experiment involved some notable features, including
                                randomized asteroid shapes, screen wrapping, tank-style controls, and a banger soundtrack written by one of my close friends! To learn

                                Random RPG is my latest (and currently occupying) project, a top-down action RPG game not dissimilar from the classic
                                Legend of Zelda titles on the NES! The original LoZ (1986) was one of my favorite old games to go back and play. It 
                                seemed very large and complex for its time, which it was able to accomplish through some genious shortcuts to fit all of
                                its content on the very limited cartridges of the time. My game, hence the name, involves some randomness as well. This 
                                is a big part of the game that is still work in progress, but essentially the worlds you will adventure in will be 
                                randomized in a variety of different ways. This is already implemented, but not to the extend to which I hope to achieve
                                one day! For more detailed information and more visuals, visit the project's linked GitHub and YouTube development
