                    <p>
                        I am an a software engineer with experience in Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, and React.js, as well as some experience
                        in a handful of other languages and frameworks. I am a graduate of the <a href="https://flatironschool.com/"><strong>Flatiron School's</strong></a>
                        Software Engineering course as of February 2023, and am seeking employment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My history with computer programming began at the start of senior year in high school, in which I took the AP Computer Science
                        program. My attention was grabbed almost immediately, and learning/writing code quickly became my largest hobby. From then until
                        October 2022, I jumped around various online resources, learning what I could along the way. Harvard's 
                        <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/games/2018/"><strong>GD50</strong></a> course was of particular interest to me, and building
                        retro-style games in the LOVE2D framework quickly became a hobby of mine.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The past few months have been spent at <a href="https://flatironschool.com/"><strong>Flatiron's</strong></a> SE bootcamp. There, I learned the
                        basics of building frontend web pages using both vanilla JS and React.js, as well as how to build a strong backend using the Ruby on Rails framework.
                        I am always eager and interested in learning new technologies to expand my technical capabilities further, and am eager to start my professional
                        career in the software development world!
