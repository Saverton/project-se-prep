                <p>
                    Hello! I am an up and coming software engineer who loves coding. in September of 2021, I found my passion for coding 
                    through taking the <a href = "https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-a"><strong>AP Computer 
                    Science</strong></a> course at my high school. I love learning new concepts and languages, and I also love working 
                    on personal projects to improve my skills. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I made it a personal goal to complete <em>every last</em> practice problem in our computer science textbook by 
                    the time of the AP test so that I would have a solid foundation in the fundamentals of programming. Furthermore, I 
                    sought out online resources to expand my knowledge and capabilities, enrolling in Harvard's 
                    <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/games/2018/"><strong>GD50</strong></a> course, all about the fundamentals of 
                    game development. Using what I learned from this course, I have worked on a small handful of larger video game 
                    projects for fun.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Having graduated from High School, I am now seeking an entryway into a career of software development, and have decided to go 
                    about it in a less traditional way. Rather than go straight into college, I am enrolling in a coding boot camp known as the
                    <a href="https://flatironschool.com/"><strong>Flatiron School</strong></a>. Once I have graduated from their incredible Software 
                    Engineeringprogram, I will seek an entry-level developer position, and gain some experience in the field before pouring 
                    excessive time and money into a degree.
