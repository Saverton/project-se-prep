PROJECT TITLE: My Personal Webpage

PROJECT DESCRIPTION: My first solo HTML/CSS/JavaScript project. It is a basic webpage that acts as a sort of resume with personal info, a list of experience levels in programming languages, and a selection of some of my GitHub projects. Uses basic JavaScript scripting to update my age with the current date as well as add expand/contract buttons to the project section to avoid unnecessary length. This project serves as my final project for the Flatiron School's software engineering prep course.

HOW TO RUN: Open https://saverton.github.io/project-se-prep/ page in a new tab
